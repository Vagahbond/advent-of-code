My solutions to advent of code 2023

Let's try the polyglot way : one day, one language !

Could not be done without [learn X in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/) !

This year, the challenge is to do a maximum of different languages.

PS: Challenge abandonne, it took me way too much time. I am going to use C# for the day 7 and then move back to languages I know and love such as C, C++, or JS/TS

- Day 1 : C
- Day 2 : Nix
- Day 3 : Pascal
- Day 4 : Rust
- Day 5 : Swift
- Day 6 : Shell
- Day 7 : Scala

Left to go:

- [ ] C++
- [ ] Sand
- [ ] Go
- [ ] Python
- [ ] JS
- [ ] TS
- [ ] PHP
- [ ] C#
- [ ] Java
- [ ] Kotlin
- [ ] shell
- [ ] ruby
- [ ] Zig
- [ ] Basic
- [ ] Dart
- [ ] Carbon
